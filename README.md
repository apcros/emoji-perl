# emoji-perl
A Perl interpreter for Emoji source code. (Yes. You read right)

## Why the f**k ? 

Because fun ?

## Ok.. I guess, but how do I write it ?

This is a pretty young language in it's earlier version so the syntax will change, but for now, here's the perl keywords and their
emojis :

- ✅ => ;
- ⚓ => sub
- ▶ => {
- ◀ => }
- 🔹 => .
- ⏪ => =
- 📌 => my
- 💲 => $
- ✴ => "
- ⌚ => time
- 📠 => print
- 💩 => use Data::Dumper; print Dumper #Will find a better solution to include. Maybe.

And then run '/bin/emoji-perl yourcode.emoji' and get ready to be blown away
